==========================================

The Code Review findings have been updated in `docs/stories/E2-S2-sqlite-schema.md`.

**Summary of actions:**
1. Attempted to build and test (`make build`), but failed due to `go` command not being found in the environment.
2. Identified a mismatch between the provided prompt Diff (renderer) and the requested Story (sqlite).
3. Retrieved the correct commit `f013a70` via `git show` and reviewed the SQLite implementation files.
4. Identified P0 issue: Build environment is broken.
5. Identified P1 issue: `internal/db/migrate.go` likely only executes the first statement of the migration SQL due to `database/sql` behavior with `ExecContext`.
6. Validated P2 issues: `LastInsertId()` error ignored, DSN construction potential issue.
7. Updated `docs/stories/E2-S2-sqlite-schema.md` with these findings.

**Note:** The prompt provided a Diff for `E1-S2-deterministic-renderer.md` but requested a review for `E2-S2-sqlite-schema.md`. I proceeded with the review for `E2-S2` based on the provided commit SHA `f013a70`.
