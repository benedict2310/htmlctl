The provided diff was reviewed.

**Status:** **P0 Issues Found**

### P0: Missing Implementation File
- **File:** `internal/cli/rollout_cmd.go` (missing from diff)
- **Issue:** `internal/cli/root.go` adds `newRolloutCmd()`, but the definition of this function is not included in the diff.
- **Impact:** Compilation failure.
- **Note:** I verified `internal/cli/rollout_cmd.go` exists on disk and implements `rollout history` using the new `ListReleasesPage`. It must be included in the patch/commit to be valid.

### P3: Unused Code (Cleanup)
- **File:** `internal/db/queries.go`
- **Issue:** `GetLatestReleaseActor` is added but appears unused (only the batch version `ListLatestReleaseActors` is used by the server).
- **Recommendation:** Remove if not intended for future use.

### Verification
- **Pagination Logic:** The client-side loop in `ListReleases` correctly handles the 200-item page limit from the server.
- **Status Logic:** The server correctly derives "previous" status for non-active releases that claim to be "active" in the DB.
- **Actor Lookup:** The batch actor lookup correctly handles the correlated subquery for latest audit logs.

**Action Required:** Include `internal/cli/rollout_cmd.go` in the diff/commit.
