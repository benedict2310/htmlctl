E4-S3 PI Review Log (Final)
==========================================
Timestamp: 2026-02-16T21:59:53Z

No P0 or P1 issues found. The implementation is solid, covering functionality, safety (hash verification, atomic switching), error handling, and auditing.

### Summary
- **P0/P1**: None.
- **P2 (Minor)**: None.

### Review Notes
- **Safety**: Robust hash verification ensures content integrity during promotion. Atomic symlink switching with rollback on transaction failure is correctly implemented.
- **Concurrency**: Environment pair locking in the server handler correctly prevents conflicting operations.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for happy path, fallback strategies (hardlink vs copy), and error conditions (hash mismatch, invalid environment).
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between core logic (`internal/release`), API handler (`internal/server`), and CLI.
- **Consistency**: Uses existing patterns for database transactions and file operations (shared with `Builder`).
