**Findings:**

1.  **Severity: P2** - **Ambiguity in Anchor ID Rule Scope**: The requirement states that the Anchor ID rule applies "if a component is used in a page layout". However, the `ValidateComponent(component *model.Component)` function signature implies stateless, isolated validation without access to the site-wide layout usage map.
    *   **Fix Suggestion**: Update the rule to be universal: "All components must have a root `id` attribute matching the component name." This simplifies validation, ensures all components are "layout-ready" by default, and allows `ValidateComponent` to function correctly in isolation.

**Missing Tests / Acceptance Criteria:**

*   No missing tests or ACs found. The verification plan is comprehensive.
