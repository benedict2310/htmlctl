**Findings:**

1.  **Severity P2:** The "Open Questions" section recommends defaulting `-o` to `./dist`, but this isn't explicitly captured in Scope or Acceptance Criteria. AC-1 uses explicit flags.
    *   **Fix:** Update Section 3 (Scope) and add an AC to explicitly state: "If `-o` is omitted, output defaults to `./dist`."
2.  **Severity P2:** AC-5 requires the `-f` flag. Typical CLIs default to the current directory if the source is omitted.
    *   **Fix:** Consider changing AC-5 to allow omitting `-f` (defaulting to `.`) or explicitly note in Section 3 that explicit source paths are required for safety/clarity.

**Missing Tests/Acceptance Criteria:**
*   None.
