Needs Work

1. **Status Inconsistency**: The story metadata shows "Status: Not Started", but the "Implementation Summary" and "Completion Status" sections indicate the work is done, and the corresponding code files (`cmd/htmlservd/main.go`, `internal/server/`, etc.) already exist in the repository.
2. **Incomplete Tracking**: Acceptance Criteria and Verification Plan checkboxes are unchecked (empty `[ ]`) despite the "Completion Status" claiming the story was implemented and validated.
3. **Lint Validation Failure**: The `story_lint.py` script fails with "Missing or invalid title line" and "Dependencies present but no parseable IDs found", suggesting potential formatting issues with the header or dependency syntax.
