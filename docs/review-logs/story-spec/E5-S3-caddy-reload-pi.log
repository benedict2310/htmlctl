**Findings:**
1. **P2 - Clarify Restore Behavior:** AC-3 states that if `caddy reload` fails, the backup is restored. It should explicitly clarify that a second `caddy reload` is *not* triggered after restoration, as the running Caddy process is presumed to still be holding the previous valid configuration in memory.
2. **P2 - Synchronous vs Asynchronous API:** AC-7 and AC-2 imply a synchronous operation where the HTTP API client waits for the reload. Ensure `caddy reload` timeouts are handled in the `Reloader` to prevent the HTTP request from hanging indefinitely if Caddy becomes unresponsive.

**Missing Tests/Acceptance Criteria:**
- No critical tests missing. The verification plan covers mock runner, failure modes, and concurrency.
